ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Nicholas "Drake" Shaub (@DrakeS55) and Welcome to my GitHub page!

I'm currently interested in learning Python to better understand data driven solutions so that I can use them in a workplace environment.
Right now, this page will contain mainly "refresher" exercises for me. However, I do plan to put some projects on here that I find interesting.
